### ReChunk

Within the domain of React Native, developers have access to a variety of rendering techniques for mobile applications, encompassing static components, dynamic components, and server-driven UI. Each of these approaches relies on adherence to a structured schema. Static components are rendered as fixed entities, while dynamic components are conditionally displayed based on predefined criteria. Server-driven UI relies on the serialization capabilities offered by specific libraries to determine the rendering output. These rendering options do not offer unlimited flexibility; rather, they require adherence to specific guidelines for rendering. Loading an additional bundle and registering it through the bridge can be complex compared to other options and may not provide a seamless user experience.

Alternatively, leveraging remotely hosted components offers a smoother rendering experience while allowing utilization of shared project dependencies and code. This approach facilitates greater flexibility and efficiency in mobile app development with React Native.
