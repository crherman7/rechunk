title: 'Server'
---

The default ReChunk instance is located in the `app` directory within this repository. You can run this server locally or host it remotely. This setup allows you to create a ReChunk project and generate a `rechunk.json` configuration file.

Before running either serving the application locally or remotely a `.env` file must be created to host the basica authentication credentials. In the `app` directory create a `.env` file with your respective credentials.

```title=".env"
RECHUNK_USERNAME=rechunk
RECHUNK_PASSWORD=aC00Lpr0ject
```

### Run Locally

Serving the application locally is an excellent way to understand how the ReChunk instance works. It also provides a great opportunity to test the integration with your React Native application independently of the development server.

After following the [Try it out](/rechunk/guides/try-it-out/) guide, the ReChunk instance can be started.

```sh
cd app
yarn dev
```

The ReChunk instance should now be running on `localhost:3000`.

### Hosting

Remotely hosting the application is an excellent way to serve it in a production environment behind a reverse proxy. The best method to expose this server is via a Docker container. A Dockerfile has already been created in this repository to generate a Docker image that can be run as a Docker container.

To build the docker image use the following command.

```sh
docker build . -t rechunk
```

Finally to run the image locally use the following command.

```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 rechunk
```

This setup enables you to utilize the CLI with http://localhost:3000 or at a custom domain behind a reverse proxy. The Docker image can be deployed and run anywhere; however, it is essential to persist the volume where this service is hosted, as the SQLite database will be created in that location.
