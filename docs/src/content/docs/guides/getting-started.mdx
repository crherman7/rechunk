ReChunk is an all-inclusive package that includes a command-line interface (CLI) and library designed for rendering encoded components with React Native. The command-line interface (CLI) is designed to work alongside an API that adheres to the interface specified in the library. You can use the Docker image right out of the box and deploy it wherever best suits your project, or alternatively, create your own server that conforms to the interface.

## Quickstart

The CLI, React Native library and Babel plugin are included in the same package. This library does not require a particular React Native version but is more related to the React version as it is expected to be utilized with Suspense via lazy loading. Suspense was introduced into React 16.6.

### Dependencies

Use your favoriate package manager to install ReChunk.

import {Tabs, TabItem} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add @crherman7/rechunk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install @crherman7/rechunk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm install @crherman7/rechunk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun install @crherman7/rechunk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This should have updated your `package.json` - verify it has been updated and ReChunk is added as a dependency.

```json ins={6} title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-awesome-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name <email@example.com>",
  "dependencies": {
    "@crherman7/rechunk": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

Additionally, be sure to update your `babel.config.js` or `.babelrc` configuration file.

```js ins={3} title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
  plugins: ['@crherman7/rechunk/plugin'],
};
```

### Configuration

As mentioned before, ReChunk is agnostic to the storage location of your chunks. ReChunk simply requires configuration to connect it to your server, which will then provide the requested chunk.

In your application, it is essential to configure ReChunk before rendering any content. ReChunk is also independent of your navigation library; it just needs to be configured prior to rendering your app, regardless of the navigation setup.

```js title="index.js" ins={2,4,7}
import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
import ReChunk from '@crherman7/rechunk';

import {fetchChunk} from './src/api';
import {App} from './src/components';

ReChunk.addConfiguration(fetchChunk, true);

AppRegistry.registerComponent('App', () => App);
```

### Initialization

To begin generating chunks, you first need to create a ReChunk project instance. You can achieve this easily using the CLI with a single command. By running the `init` command provided by ReChunk, you can generate a new ReChunk project.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn rechunk init --host https://myrehunkserver.abc --username myrechunkusername --password myrechunkpassword
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run rechunk init --host http://myrehunkserver.abc --username myrechunkusername --password myrechunkpassword
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm rechunk init --host http://myrehunkserver.abc --username myrechunkusername --password myrechunkpassword
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun run rechunk init --host http://myrehunkserver.abc --username myrechunkusername --password myrechunkpassword
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Running the `init` command will generate a `rechunk.json` file at the root of your React Native project. This file contains private and public information related to your ReChunk project. Importantly, do not include this JSON configuration directly into your project, as it may bundle sensitive information into your app's build. The host refers to the server where your ReChunk instance is deployed. The username and password are used as basic authentication credentials to access this instance.
