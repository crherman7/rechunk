This guide demonstrates how to quickly evaluate the library to determine its suitability for your project.

### Repository

The first step is to clone the repository to your machine. Ensure you have followed the [environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.73/getting-started) for at least React Native version 0.73.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:crherman7/rechunk.git
```

Next, navigate to the `rechunk` directory and install the dependencies using the Yarn package manager.

```sh
cd rechunk
yarn install
```

After installing the dependencies, the package needs to be built, which involves compiling TypeScript into JavaScript.

```sh
yarn build
```

### App

The example application can now be run successfully with the ReChunk development server. Before you can the iOS application, pods must be installed.

```sh
cd example/ios
pod install
cd ..
```

After all the pods have been installed, you can start the ReChunk development server.

```sh
yarn rechunk dev-server
```

In a separate terminal the iOS application can now be run.

```sh
yarn ios
```

The iOS mobile application should now be running and the remote chunk should be rendered. This can also be run for android as well.

```sh
yarn android
```
