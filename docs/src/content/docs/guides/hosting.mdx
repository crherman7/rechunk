The ReChunk service is as crucial as the ReChunk library because it stores your bundled and signed components. Our objective following the release of version 1 of this library is to offer an out-of-the-box hosted solution for developers who prefer not to host their own service. It is important to note that this library is designed with a host-agnostic approach, so we do not want to force you into using a solution that may not meet your needs. There is an interface that the command-line interface (CLI) adheres to, as defined in the [swagger.json](https://crherman7.github.io/rechunk/swagger.json). This allows anyone to create a fully custom back-end experience, provided it complies with this interface.

### Docker

Our Dockerized ReChunk service is built on Hono, SQLite, and Drizzle-ORM, offering a lightweight solution for securely persisting chunks. To build this image, fork the repository, add a `.env` file containing the `RECHUNK_USERNAME` and `RECHUNK_PASSWORD` environment variables, and build the Docker image. These environment variables are used for Basic Authentication on the `/project` POST endpoint.

```env title=".env"
RECHUNK_USERNAME=rechunk
RECHUNK_PASSWORD=aC00Lpr0ject
```

To build the docker image use the following command.

```sh
docker build -f app/Dockerfile . -t rechunk
```

Finally to run the image locally use the following command.

```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 rechunk
```

This setup enables you to utilize the CLI with http://localhost:3000. The Docker image can be deployed and run anywhere; however, it is essential to persist the volume where this service is hosted, as the SQLite database will be created in that location.
